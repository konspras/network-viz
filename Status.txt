Quick status: I scaffolded a Vite + TypeScript app, added PixiJS for fast 2D, built a simple network scene with hosts/switches, animated packets, and mock time series. You can Play/Pause/Reset and change speed. The dev server runs cleanly and a production build passes.

What you have now

Toolbar: Play/Pause, Reset, Speed slider, time label
Visualization:
Links width/color reflect per-link throughput
Node color and a small bar reflect per-node queue
Packets are little dots moving along predefined paths
Mock data: random-but-smooth time series plus random packet events
Files:
src/viz/data.ts: mock topology, time series, events
src/viz/scene.ts: PixiJS rendering and animation
src/viz/app.ts: ticker, playback controller
README with run/build and customization notes
Note: The starter file counter.ts was removed; safe to close in your editor.
Try it

It should already be running at http://localhost:5173
If needed, run:
npm install
npm run dev
Would you like me to iterate? Here are focused next steps to choose from:

Load real data

I’ll add a JSON/CSV loader, linear interpolation, and a small “Load file” button.
Confirm your preferred format (the README proposes a JSON shape). Are times in seconds? Are values normalized [0..1] or raw?
Timeline controls

Add a scrubber (seek bar), step forward/back, and a “loop” toggle.
Interaction and layout

Zoom/pan, node dragging, tooltips with per-node/link metrics, link labels.
Optional auto layout (force-directed or DAG).
Visual refinements

Distinct shapes for hosts/switches, per-link arrows, nicer color scales, glow effects.
Export for PowerPoint

One-click record to WebM/MP4 or export frames/GIF; screenshot button.
Config-driven scenes

A simple config panel to pick dataset, toggle overlays, choose color scales.
Tell me which direction you prefer (1–6), and I’ll implement it next. If you want to start with real data, share a small sample and I’ll wire it in.
